# TODO 

* Update UI pane after Hydration
* Add Chirp delete
* Add Chirp edit
* Analyze for O() 
* Transform to a backend REST API
* Transform to using sqlite database backend.

## Done

* Add a Celebrity (> 4 followers) to the Hydration routine.

* What will happen when a user breaks the celebrity threshold - will chirps be doubled up in timeline?
  It's OK, the earlier chirps are not celebrity chiprs.
